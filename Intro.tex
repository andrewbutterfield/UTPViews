\section{Introduction}

Encoding views as per \cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}
in UTP.

All references in bold to things
like \textbf{Definition 9} or \textbf{Parameter E} refer to corresponding material
in the above cited paper.

The generic definitions from\cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}
are in Appendix \ref{sec:viewdefs}.


\subsection{Related Work}

The UTP views paper by van Staden\cite{DBLP:conf/utp/Staden14}
starts algebraically, looking at Kleene alebras over languages.
Languages here are sets of string over an alphabet $A$.
He then takes $A =\Sigma\times\Sigma$,
which in effect encodes the Brookes model\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Brookes96}
(see also Park\cite{conf/ac/Park79}).
