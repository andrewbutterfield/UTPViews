\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

The UTP views paper by van Staden\cite{DBLP:conf/utp/Staden14}
starts algebraically, looking at Kleene alebras over languages.
Languages here are sets of string over an alphabet $A$.
He then takes $A =\Sigma\times\Sigma$,
which in effect encodes the Brookes model\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Brookes96}
(see also Park\cite{conf/ac/Park79}).

This paper may provide a way for me to prove all the laws hold for
my formulation of UTCP.


Needed: a description of prior compositional semantics
for shared-variable concurrency,
including Brookes, de Boer, something from actions systems (Mosses?)
and Petri-Nets (?).
Want to explore the role of stuttering and mumbling,
at least in the Brookes and de Boer work.

Glynn Winskel's fibrations as a unification principle?
