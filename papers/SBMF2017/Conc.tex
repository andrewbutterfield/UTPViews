\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

We have presented a compositional, denotational UTP semantics
of shared-variable concurrency.
It is ``explicit'' in the sense that it can enumerate all the observations
that it is possible make of the program's own behaviour, in any time-slot.

The usefulness of this theory is that it is in a form that makes it very
easy for us to link it to other UTP theories about approaches to concurrency,
such as Rely-Guarantee\cite{DBLP:phd/ethos/Jones81,On-RG:vanStaden15},
Owicki-Gries\cite{DBLP:journals/acta/OwickiG76},
Concurrent Seperation Logic\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Brookes11},
all featured in the Views paper.
This is precisely because it is formulated as a before-after relation,
with the twist that before and after observations can occur at any time
during program execution, with the obvious proviso that
``before'' precedes ``after''.
