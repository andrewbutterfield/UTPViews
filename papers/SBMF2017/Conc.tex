\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

Want to observe the two kinds of UTP theories of s.v. concurrency:
those that explicitly model interference (e.g. vanStaden out of Brookes),
and those that focus only on the program (e.g. UTPP and UTCP presented here.)

Point out why rely-guarantee really belongs to the latter camp above.
