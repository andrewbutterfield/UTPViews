\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conc}

We have presented a compositional, denotational UTP semantics
of shared-variable concurrency.
It is ``explicit'' in the sense that it can enumerate all the observations
that it is possible make of the program's own behaviour, in any time-slot.
As already explained, our semantics has a lot of similarities to the axiomatic action semantics of Lamport \cite{Lamport1985}.

The usefulness of this theory is that it is in a form that makes it very
easy for us to specialise it to cover
other approaches to concurrency in the Views paper \cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13},
as that paper shows how thay all link to the simple concurrent language whose semantics we have just supplied.
These concurrency approaches include Rely-Guarantee\cite{DBLP:phd/ethos/Jones81,On-RG:vanStaden15},
Owicki-Gries\cite{DBLP:journals/acta/OwickiG76}, and
Concurrent Separation Logic\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/Brookes11}.
This is precisely because it is formulated as a before-after relation,
with the twist that before and after observations can occur at any time
during program execution, with the obvious proviso that
``before'' precedes ``after''.
