\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

Key work was done on concurrent semantics in the 80s and 90s,
with a strong focus on fully abstract denotational
semantics.
Notable work form this period includes that by
Stephen Brookes\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Brookes96}
and Frank de Boer and colleagues\cite{DBLP:conf/concur/BoerKPR91}.
Both looked at denotations based on the notion of sets of transition traces,
these being sequences of pairs of before-after states.
In order to get compositionality the traces of any program fragment
had to have arbitrary ``stuttering'' and ``mumbling'' state-pairs
added to capture the notion of outside interference.
Full abstraction meant that the semantics had to identify
programs like $skip\cseq skip$ with $skip$,
while distinguishing between $x:=2$ and $x:=1\cseq x:=x+1$.

The first UTP theory in this area was presented in
the UTPP paper\cite{DBLP:conf/icfem/WoodcockH02}.
This combined guarded commands\cite{1976:book:dijkstra}
with the idea of action systems\cite{PODC::BackK1983},
interpreted in UTP as non-deterministic choice
over guarded atomic actions,
where disabled actions behave like the unit for that choice.
This basic lattice-theoretic architecture for the UTPP semantics
forms the foundation and inspiration for the UTCP semantics presented here.

More recently, also inspired by \cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13},
the  ``UTP Views'' paper by van Staden\cite{DBLP:conf/utp/Staden14},
starts algebraically, looking at Kleene algebras over languages.
Languages here are sets of strings over an alphabet $A$.
He then takes $A =\Sigma\times\Sigma$,
which in effect encodes the Brookes model\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Brookes96}.
His semantics fits with the usual UTP approach to concurrency,
in that it is based on traces as sequences of some notion of event.


All the compositional
semantic frameworks we have discussed in this section
are based on this notion of sets of transition traces,
but we are seeking a semantics based on direct relations
between before- and after-program states,
without any explicit notion of traces.
The reason for this is that the resulting UTP theory will have
a form that will make it easier to link to concurrency approaches
such as rely-guarantee, or separation logic, that
are used with languages that are imperative and program-variable based.

There is however a semantics for shared-variable concurrency
that is much closer in form to the one developed in this paper.
This is the ``actions with axioms'' approach of Lamport \cite{Lamport1985}.
In this, the semantics of each language construct is given by a set
of axioms, that are predicates over both program variables,
and auxilliary variables that manage flow of control.
The meaning of a composite is given by taking the axioms that
describe each of its components, and combining them with appropriate
renamings.
This requires being able to identify specific sub-components
of any given component, and a syntactical method for doing this
is described.

We were not aware of this work when we developed the UTCP theory
in this paper,
but there are very strong parallels between the features of our
semantics and those in \cite{Lamport1985}.
In some sense our semantics is a re-working of his within UTP.
We shall point out specific correspondences as we proceed with our presentatiomn.
