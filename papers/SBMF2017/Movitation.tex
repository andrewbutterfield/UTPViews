We have recently started to explore using UTP
to describe shared-variable concurrency,
by adapting the work of the  UTP semantics for Unifying Theories
of Parallel Programming (UTPP) \cite{DBLP:conf/icfem/WoodcockH02}.
We have reworked it to use a system for generating unique labels,
in order to give a slight improvement to the compositionality
of the semantics.
This we call a Unifying Theory of Concurrent Programming (UTCP)\cite{conf/tase/BMN16}.
