\subsection{Motivation}\label{ssec:motivate}

The Views paper\cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}
presented a unification of a number of different approaches to reasoning
about shared-variable concurrency,
by showing how they could all be mapped onto a common base-language
that they called the Command language.
From a UTP perspective,
we saw this as an excellent launch-pad for the kind of theory unification
that is of interest to us.
On a separate note,
research collaboration lead us to give a UTP semantics to a process modelling
language called PML\cite{DBLP:journals/infsof/AtkinsonWN07},
which has the notion of basic actions that require certain resources to run,
and which provide further resources as a result.
Actions can be combined
using sequencing, selection, branching and iteration.
It turns out that PML is isomorphic to the Command language,
and first steps towards
a formal compositional UTP semantics of both was developed
\cite{conf/tase/BMN16}.
This paper moves that work on to present
a compositional UTP semantics for Commands.
