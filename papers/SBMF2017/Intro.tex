\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

In this paper we present a compositional UTP semantics
for the shared-variable concurrent ``Command'' language described
in the POPL13 ``Views'' paper\cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}.
We use a slightly different syntax to that in the above cited paper:
\RLEQNS{
   a &\in& \Atom         & \mbox{Atomic state-change actions}
\\ C &::=& \catom a      & \mbox{Atomic Command}
\\  &\mid& C \cseq C     & \mbox{Command Sequential Compostion}
\\  &\mid& C+C           &\mbox{Command Non-deterministic Choice}
\\  &\mid& C \parallel C &\mbox{Command Parallel Compostion}
\\  &\mid& C^*           &\mbox{Command Non-deterministic Iteration}
} \noindent
The reason for the difference is because
we need to distinguish between the Command language operators above,
and conceptually similar operators in the underlying UTP semantics,
which is explained, in context, in Sec \ref{sec:observe}.
