\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

In this paper we present a compositional UTP semantics
for the shared-variable concurrent ``Command'' language described
in the POPL13 ``Views'' paper\cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}.
We use a slightly different syntax to that in the above cited paper,
where $\Atom$ is a set of atomic state-change operations,:
\begin{eqnarray*}
   a &\in& \Atom
\\ C &::=& \catom a \mid C \cseq C \mid C+C \mid C \parallel C \mid C^*
\end{eqnarray*}
The reason for the difference is explained, in context, in Sec \ref{sec:observe}.
