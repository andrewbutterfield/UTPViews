%\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

While careful inspection and test calculations
give us a high level of confidence in the validity of our semantics,
we still need to demonstrate that the algebraic laws
of Concurrent Kleene Algebra\cite{Hoare2009}
can be derived from our semantics.
We also need to show how the standard operational semantics can be recovered.

We also hope to use this semantics as a baseline for a program to apply UTP
to model the various linked approaches discussed in the Views paper\cite{conf/popl/Dinsdale-YoungBGPY13}.
Of particular interest is to explore the connection
between UTCP and rely-guarantee\cite{PhD:CBJones:1981} approaches.
In particular,
given our idea of ``before'' and ``after'' being able to refer intermediate
execution points, and that we can explicitly provide all atomic actions and their mumblings,
we see a good opportunity to explore how this can be exploited
to analyse how well one or more program steps satisfy their
guarantee obligation, given a reliable environment.

Given the similarities between our approach and that of Lamport,
it also raises the possibility of bringing our observations
and notation closer in line with his.
