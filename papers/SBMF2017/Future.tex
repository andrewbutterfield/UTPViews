%\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

While careful inspection and test calculations
give us a high level of confidence in the validity of our semantics,
we still need to demonstrate that the algebraic laws
of Concurrent Kleene Algebra\cite{Hoare2009}
can be derived from our semantics.
We also need to show how the standard operational semantics can be recovered.

Of particular interest is to explore the connection
between UTCP and rely-guarantee.
Given that we can explictly provide all atomic actions and their mumblings,
we see a good opportunity to explore how this can be exploited
to analyse how well one or more program steps satisfy their
guarantee obligation, given a reliable environment.
