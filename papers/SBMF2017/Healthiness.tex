\subsection{Label-Set Invariants}

The semantics we propose here depends on the careful management
of when specific labels are, or are not,
present in the global label-set $ls$.
We are looking at a situation where the semantics of any construct
requires associating unique labels with its entry and exit points,
as well as having a label generator provided for use with any sub-components
it might have.

So, from the perspective of any well-program $P$,
we have the following three (static) observation variables.
\RLEQNS{
   in, out &:& Lbl
\\ g &:& Gen
}
Key to the success of this semantics is a collection of label-set invariants
which characterise proper label-set contents,
which are preserved by all label-set manipulations performed
by our semantic definitions.

\subsubsection{Disjoint Labels (DL)}\label{sssec:disjoint-labels}

The first invariant we have is simply one that asserts,
for every construct, that $in$, $out$ and the labels of $g$
are all different
\footnote{The theory can be developed using only $g$ as a static observation,
and letting $\ell_g$ and $\ell_{g:}$ play the role of $in$ and $out$
respectively, in which case Disjoint Labels is automatically satisfied.
However, while this results in an entirely equivalent theory,
it is notationally much more obscure
with definitions and results that are harder to interpret and check.
}%
\RLEQNS{
   in \neq out &\land& \setof{in,out} \cap labs(g) = \emptyset
   & \ecite{Disjoint-Labels}
}



\subsubsection{Label Exclusivity (LE)}\label{sssec:label-exclusivity}

In addition to Disjoint Labels above,
which merely ensures distinctness of labels themselves,
we also need stronger invariants regarding which labels can, or cannot,
occur in the global label set at any one time.
There is not one such Label Exclusivity invariant,
but rather we have that each language construct defines it own
variation, in order to ensure that flow of control is correctly managed.

There is a general version of the invariant, as follows:
\RLEQNS{
   &&
   in \in  ls \implies (\setof{out} \cup labs(g))\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   (labs(g) \cap  ls \neq \emptyset) \implies \setof{in,out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   out \in ls \implies (\setof{in} \cup labs(g))\cap ls = \emptyset
   & \ecite{Exclusive-Labels}
}

We also more specific invariants, specific to each composite language construct.
We start with one of the simplest,
namely that used by sequential composition.
It asserts that any point in time,
only one of $in$, $\ell_g$ or $out$ can be present in $ls$:
\RLEQNS{
   &&
   in \in  ls \implies \setof{\ell_g,out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   \setof{\ell_g} \subseteq ls \implies \setof{in,out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   out \in ls \implies \setof{in,\ell_g}\cap ls = \emptyset
}
The most complex example is that for parallel composition.
Here we have four labels in addition to $in$ and $out$,
namely $\ell_{g1}$, $\ell_{g1:}$, $\ell_{g2}$, and $\ell_{g2:}$.
They should not occupy $ls$ at the same time as either $in $ or $out$,
but we also have that only one of the pair $(\ell_{g1},\ell_{g1:})$
can be present at the same time,
and the same must hold  for $(\ell_{g2},\ell_{g2:})$.
\RLEQNS{
   &&
   in \in ls
   \implies
   \setof{\ell_{g1},\ell_{g1:},\ell_{g2},\ell_{g2:},out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   \ell_{g1} \in ls \implies \setof{in,\ell_{g1:},out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   \ell_{g1:} \in ls \implies \setof{in,\ell_{g1},out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   \ell_{g2} \in ls \implies \setof{in,\ell_{g2:},out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   \ell_{g2:} \in ls \implies \setof{in,\ell_{g2},out}\cap ls = \emptyset
\\ &\land&
   out \in ls
   \implies
   \setof{in, \ell_{g1},\ell_{g1:},\ell_{g2},\ell_{g2:}}\cap ls = \emptyset
}
The precise motivation for these will be explained when the relevant
construct semantics are being described later.
For now we simply observe,
that these invariants are quite bulky and complex.



\subsubsection{Label-Set Invariant Notation}

First we shorten $labs(g)$ to just $g$ when this is clear from context,
i.e., a label-set, rather than a generator, is expected.

The Disjoint Labels invariant basically asserts
that a number of sets of labels are mutually disjoint.
We use the following shorthand, where the $L_i$ are label-sets,
\RLEQNS{
   \setof{L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n}
   &\defs&
   \forall_{i,j \in 1\dots n}
    @
    i \neq j \implies L_i \cap L_j = \emptyset
\\ \multicolumn{3}{c}{\elabel{short-disj-lbl}}
}
So we have an alternative definition of the Disjoint Labels invariant:
\RLEQNS{
 && \setof{in|g|out} & \elabel{Disjoint-Labels}
}

In a similar vein, we use a similar shorthand notation
for the Label Exclusivity invariants.
We use a shorthand,
whose easy cases can be formulated as follows:
\RLEQNS{
   ~[L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n]
   &\defs&
   \forall_{i,j \in 1\dots n}
    @
    i \neq j \implies
     ( L_i \cap ls \neq \emptyset \implies L_j \cap ls = \emptyset )
\\ \multicolumn{3}{c}{\elabel{short-lbl-exclusive}}
}
So the sequential composition Label Exclusivity invariant
is simply: $[in|\ell_g|out]$.
What needs to be kept in mind regarding this shorthand notation
is that $ls$ is mentioned under the hood,
and it is really all about what can be present in the global label-set
at any instant in time.

For parallel composition, we a little more complexity.
In shorthand it is expressed as
\[
   [in|(\ell_{g1}|\ell_{g1:}),(\ell_{g2}|\ell_{g2:})|out].
\]
It asserts at the top-level that $ls$
may contain only $in$, only $out$,
or only labels in $\ell_{g1},\ell_{g1:},\ell_{g2},\ell_{g2:}$.
In addition however, $\ell_{g1}$ and $\ell_{g1:}$ cannot occur together
and neither can $\ell_{g2}$ and $\ell_{g2:}$.

A more detailed and formal description of this way of describing
these invariants, in terms of an different abstract notation,
is presented in \S\ref{ssec:exclusive-lsat}.

\subsubsection{Properties of DL and LE}

Consider the following two generic examples:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    $DL_n = \{L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n\}$
    asserts that each $L_i$ is disjoint from any other.
  \item
    $LE_n = [L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n]$
    asserts that if elements one $L_i$ are in $ls$,
    then no elements from the others are.
\end{enumerate}

The ordering in either invariant is immaterial.
If $\rho$ is a permutation over $\setof{1\dots n}$ then
\RLEQNS{
   \{L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n\} &=& \{L_{\rho1}|L_{\rho2}|\dots|L_{\rho n}\}
   & \elabel{DL-perm}
\\ ~[L_1|L_2|\dots|L_n] &=& [L_{\rho1}|L_{\rho2}|\dots|L_{\rho n}]
   & \elabel{LE-perm}
}
Both invariants imply shorter versions of themselves:
\RLEQNS{
   \{\dots|L_{i-1}|L_i|L_{i+1}\dots\} &\implies& \{\dots|L_{i-1}|L_{i+1}\dots\}
   & \elabel{DL-drop}
\\ ~[\dots|L_{i-1}|L_i|L_{i+1}\dots] &\implies& [\dots|L_{i-1}|L_{i+1}\dots]
   & \elabel{LE-drop}
}
Both invariants imply versions with smaller sets:
\RLEQNS{
   S_i \subseteq L_i \land \{L_1|\dots|L_n\}
   &\implies& \{S_1|\dots|S_n\}
   & \elabel{DL-subset}
\\ S_i \subseteq L_i \land [L_1|\dots|L_n]
   &\implies& [S_1|\dots|S_n]
   & \elabel{DL-subset}
}
A key property shared by all LE invariants,
is that they are trivially satisfied by $ls = \emptyset$,
or if $ls$ only contains labels not mentioned in the invariant.
\RLEQNS{
   scope(LE_n) &\defs& L_1 \cup L_2 \cup \dots \cup L_n
\\ (ls = ls \setminus scope(LE_n)) &\implies& LE_n = \true
    & \elabel{LE-out-of-scope}
\\ ls = \emptyset &\implies& LE_n = \true
    & \elabel{LE-trivial}
}
There is no simple relationship between $DL_n$ and $LE_n$.
It is possible for one to be true when the other is false.
\begin{description}
  \item[DL true, LE false]
    $L_1 \cap L_2 = \emptyset \quad\land\quad (L_1 \cup L_2) \subseteq ls$.
  \item[DL false, LE true]
    $L_1 = L_2 \quad\land\quad L_1 \cap ls = \emptyset$
\end{description}
