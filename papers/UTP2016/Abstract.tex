\begin{abstract}
A recent devolvement of interest in concurrency has been the
notion of ``Views'' as a common framework in which to consider
a number of different reasoning formalisms,
ranging from type-systems, the Owicki-Gries approach, Rely-Guarantee,
and Separation Logic.
In effect Views are an abstraction of concurrent behaviour
that allows a range of formal approaches to be shown to be
specific instances of that abstraction.
We are proposing to use the Unifying Theory of Programming paradigm
to capture not only the Views abstraction and its various instantiations,
but to explore using Galois connections to link those instantiations together.
This will allow us to apply formal reasoning techniques to algorithms
that do require ``mixed reasoning'',
for example, a mix of separation logic and rely-guarantee.
To this this we present a denotational UTP semantics of the base Command
language in the Views paper,
and explore the issues in connecting that
to both the algebraic and operational semantics.
